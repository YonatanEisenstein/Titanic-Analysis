# Titanic-Analysis
In this project I analyze the classic Titanic survivers DataSet.

I managed to make some preprocessing and exploratory data analysis work, 
then I used some Machine and deep learning models to predict whether a passenger will survive or not.

I compare the models to what I call a "foolish" classifier (based on one feature to predict if passenger will survive), thus show that the models do a good prediction job.

In addition, I show how overfitting can corrupt model performances in regard with the Test set, and use the callback method to prevent overfitting.
